Abstract—Adapting to the dynamic rules of Blackjack, a popular classic card game played in casinos, often requires advanced strategies. This paper focuses on one such strategy in reinforcement learning that can significantly impact strategic play. The key objective of this paper is to introduce the reinforcement learning algorithm, the Q-learning algorithm to play Blackjack efficiently by adapting itself to the rules. A Blackjack environment is implemented with Basic Strategies, and Complete Point Counting techniques embedded with specific Rule Variation, such as 6-to-5 Blackjack Payout and Prohibition of double down when hard 11. The performance of Q-learning is tested and compared against multiple scenarios like a random selection of an action, and a traditional method of game. The study also examines, how the changes in the rules can impact a player’s chances of winning or losing the game. The experimental results showcase the remarkable improvement in its strategy, flexibility, and efficiency achieving higher win rates and better decision-making under varying conditions. The core findings demonstrate the potential feature of Q-learning its ability to flexibly adapt to the environment.
